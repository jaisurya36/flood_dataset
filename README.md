
🌊 Flood Prediction & Analysis 🌊

📌 Project Theme: Climate Risk & Disaster Management (Flood Analysis)

This project is part of the Shell AI Green Internship program.
The goal is to analyze flood-related data 🌧️, explore patterns 📊, and build an AI-based prediction system 🤖 to help in disaster risk reduction and climate adaptation.

🗓️ Weekly Progress:
✅ Week 1: Data Understanding

📥 Imported dataset using Pandas

🔍 Performed .info(), .describe(), .isnull().sum()

📊 Checked missing values and dataset shape

✅ Week 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Transformation

📈 Histograms of Rainfall, River Levels, Soil Moisture, Temperature

🔥 Countplot for Flood distribution (0 = No Flood, 1 = Flood)

📦 Data transformation (encoding + handling missing values)

🧠 Feature correlation heatmap for variable relationships

📊 Dataset Information

🌧️ Rainfall_mm → Rainfall in millimeters

🌊 River_Level_m → River water level in meters

🌱 Soil_Moisture_% → Soil moisture percentage

🌡️ Temperature_C → Temperature in Celsius

🏙️ Population_Density → Number of people per unit area

🚨 Flood (0 = No Flood, 1 = Flood) → Target variable

🚀 Tools & Technologies

🐍 Python 3.12

📓 Jupyter Notebook (VS Code)

📊 Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

🖥️ GitHub for version control

🌟 Future Plans (Week 3 & Beyond)

🔮 Build ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

🎯 Evaluate performance with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

📡 Develop a simple web app (Streamlit/Flask) for real-time flood prediction

☁️ Deploy on Heroku / GitHub Pages
✅ Week 4 – Deployment

Built Streamlit app for real-time flood prediction

Deployed on Streamlit Cloud 🌍
